# Text_Frequency_Analysis

## Motivation
In the famous series 'The Lord of the Rings', the journey characters make has a lot of walking. We wanted to analyze the frequency of "walking" that appears per page in each book and compare the frequency between each book. We assumed that the frequency of "walking" will have a Possion distribution.

## Implementations
- Created a Java program that removes all characters besides English alphabet letters and space between words and outputs a new text file that contains only letters
- Created a Python program that reads in the text file and captures the frequency of the word "walk" per book 
- Analyzed text frequency using R
